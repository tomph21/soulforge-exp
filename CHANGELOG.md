## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-04

### Bug Fixes

- make headless test TTY-independent
- detect brew install when ~/.soulforge/bin shadows PATH\n\nBrew's post-install copies the binary to ~/.soulforge/bin/, which\nshadows the brew symlink at $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/soulforge in PATH.\nThis caused detectInstallMethod() to fall through to \"binary\".\n\nFix: directly check if $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/soulforge exists as a\nsymlink — the one artifact only brew creates.

### Other

- skip bus coordination tools for desloppify/verifier

Solo post-processing agents dont need report_finding,
check_findings, or check_edit_conflicts — no peers to
coordinate with. skipBusTools flag on agent creators,
set automatically for desloppify/verifier agentIds.
Bus cache (wrapWithBusCache) still active for file reads.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- hide task text for desloppify/verifier in dispatch display

The agentId + tier label (cleanup/verify) already identifies them.
No need to show the raw prompt text which starts with RULES block.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- drop hallucinated files, coerce weak model read args
- agent lifecycle: unified result handling, display fixes, soul map UX

Result handling:
- extractFinalText: last step text, not concatenated result.text
- calledDone → succeeded: derived from agent text + edits, not ghost done tool
- removed extractDoneResult (done tool never existed)
- desloppify/verifier routed through runAgentTask (no duplicate code)

Display:
- agent role label from info.role not tier (explore ember no longer shows [code])
- succeeded drives checkmark (✓) vs warning (!)
- hideOther prop on PendingQuestion for single-option prompts

Soul Map wait UX:
- interactive prompt with live progress (files, symbols, phase)
- "Proceed without Soul Map" button, auto-dismiss on ready
- scan errors shown in prompt text
- child contexts defer to parent isRepoMapReady (was files>0 bug)
- Ctrl+X aborts cleanly via AbortSignal

Timer:
- loadingStartedAt set after Soul Map wait, not on submit
- headless startTime after setupAgent

Step limits: 12 explore / 18 code, nudge at 8/12
Nudges: action-oriented ("stop and report") not budget-aware ("step 8/12")

Headless: waitForRepoMap with 30s timeout and progress message

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- start counting after Soul Map wait, not on submit
- use waitForRepoMap with 30s timeout and progress
- soul map wait: show scan errors in prompt, cleaner progress

- scan failure shown in question text (user decides to proceed)
- removed stall auto-skip (user should decide, not timeout)
- progress shows file/symbol counts from repo map store

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- hide "Other" option via explicit hideOther prop on PendingQuestion

Added hideOther?: boolean to PendingQuestion interface.
QuestionPrompt checks it to show/hide the free-text option.
Soul Map wait prompt sets hideOther: true.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- soul map wait: interactive prompt with live progress

When Soul Map is not ready on message submit:
- shows a PendingQuestion with live progress (files, symbols, phase)
- progress updates every 500ms from the repo map store
- user can click "Proceed without Soul Map" to skip (with warning)
- auto-dismisses when Soul Map finishes (200ms poll)
- respects Ctrl+X abort
- warns about reduced capabilities if proceeding without

waitForRepoMap: accepts AbortSignal for clean cancellation

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- soul map wait: abort-aware, clearer messaging

- waitForRepoMap accepts AbortSignal — Ctrl+X during indexing cancels
  the wait cleanly instead of hanging until timeout
- wait message simplified: "Soul Map indexing… will proceed when ready."
- timeout warning is now a system message with reduced-capabilities note

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- add dispatch testing notes

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- app layout fixes, icons, skills lockfile update
- plan tool: JSON array coercion + schema refinements

- coerceJsonArray preprocessor for array fields (handles stringified JSON)
- refined plan file/step schemas for clarity

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- router settings: spark/ember labels + proxy perf defaults

RouterSettings: renamed slots to match spark/ember terminology
- "Code Agent" → "Explore", "Exploration" → "Code"
- added icons to slot labels
- simplified section subtitles

Proxy lifecycle: auto-inject performance defaults into proxy config
- retry, keepalive, streaming settings for reliability
- versioned marker block (replaced on version bump)
- skips injection if user already has conflicting keys

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- /context panel: scope-aware tabs, token fixes, display cleanup

StatusDashboard redesign:
- scope selector (←→ arrows) to view per-tab or aggregate token usage
- single tab: no scope selector, identical to before
- multi-tab: Tab 1 / Tab 2 / All — each shows full breakdown
- "All" scope: aggregated tokens + per-tab summary table
  (Input / Output / Cache% / Cost columns)
- context window/compaction/system prompt shown for all tab scopes
  (hidden only in "All" aggregate view)

Token reporting fixes:
- compaction preserves cacheRead/cacheWrite/subagentInput/subagentOutput
  (was zeroed by ...ZERO_USAGE spread)
- BarRow/EntryRow right padding (values no longer touch border)
- BarRow descW param for aligned bars across rows

ToolCallDisplay cleanup:
- removed compact prop (always show last running step only)
- fresh agent shows thinking spinner (removed doneCount>0 gate)
- removed dead `true` in memo comparator

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- spark/ember architecture with clean classification and lean prompts
### Testing

- update agent-results budget cap expectations
## [1.9.0] — 2026-04-03

### Bug Fixes

- fix loading timer persistence across lock-in toggle

Share loadingStartedAt timestamp from parent TabInstance so the
elapsed timer survives toggling between lock-in and default view
instead of resetting to 0.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- detect brew install method for homebrew-wrapped binary
### Features

- prompt engineering overhaul + soul_grep dep fix + soul_find ranking
- programmatic tool calling (smithy) + code execution UI nesting
- token-efficient prompt + tab layout fix + disable unused tools
### Other

- project tool: expose "check" action in input schema

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- project tool: add "check" action — runs typecheck+lint+test in parallel

Move runCommand above the null guard and handle "check" with an early
return so TypeScript correctly narrows command to non-null for the
remaining single-action path.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- read tool: show callees and qualified names in symbol output

Add getCalleesForSymbol to repo-map and wire through intelligence worker
so the read tool can show what a symbol calls (top 10 callees). Also
propagate qualifiedName through getFileSymbolRanges so bus-cache and
read-file display Class.method instead of just method.

Symbol outline now shows "Calls: foo, bar, baz" when reading a function,
giving the agent immediate understanding of a symbol's dependencies.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- duplication detection: reduce false positives with smarter filtering

- Skip parent-contains-child matches (intra-function nesting)
- Skip pairs where both are type declarations (similar AST ≠ duplication)
- Skip pairs of short variables (<10 lines) — config literals are noise
- For sub-95% matches, compare signature tokens and skip when signatures
  diverge (sigSim < 0.3) — different intent despite similar structure
- Join symbols table to get kind + signature for filtering context

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- soul map: show top caller names in symbol badges instead of just counts

Replace getCallerCounts with getCallerDetails that returns top 3 caller
names per symbol. Badges now show e.g. [useChat, renderMessage, +5↑]
instead of [7↑], giving the agent immediate context about who uses each
symbol without needing navigate(references).

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- update tests for read_file → read rename

Mechanical update of all test files to use the new `read` tool name
in test fixtures, assertions, and descriptions.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- strip programmatic tool calling for Haiku subagents

Add supportsProgrammaticToolCalling() check — Claude 4+ non-Haiku only.
Subagent tool wrapper strips providerOptions (allowedCallers) from tools
when the model doesn't support it, preventing API errors with Haiku.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- improve architect, socratic, and auto mode prompts

- Architect: add "Critical Files" list requirement, recommend next mode
- Socratic: add web_search guidance, structured option presentation,
  progress from broad to specific investigation
- Auto: add safety rails (destructive action confirmation, no secret
  exfiltration), error recovery strategy (3 attempts then pivot),
  verify after each logical unit

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- add rotating hint system to footer with glitch transitions

Periodically swap keyboard shortcuts with contextual tips about
SoulForge features (modes, LSP, tabs, themes, headless, etc.).

- 30+ hints covering modes, intelligence, tabs, router, git, skills,
  themes, headless CLI, and discovery features
- Elimination-random bag: each hint shows once before any repeats
- Garble glitch transition animation between shortcuts and hints
- Highlighted segments for commands/keywords in brand color
- Auto-truncation for narrow terminals

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- enhance error display with flavor text, codes, and stream errors

Richer error categorization in chat messages:
- Extract HTTP status codes and error type codes from raw messages
- Add forge-themed flavor text per error category
- Add stream error category (INTERNAL_ERROR, api_error)
- Show error code badge [429] and flavor text in header
- Use accentUser/accentAssistant for user/assistant message borders
- Fix error text color (was t.error, now t.textSecondary for readability)

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- update all read_file references to read

Mechanical rename of read_file → read across agents, tools, prompts,
and documentation. Updates tool hints, error messages, descriptions,
and intercept suggestions to use the new read(files=[...]) syntax.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- track symbol endLine across intelligence stack

Propagate endLine from all intelligence backends (LSP, tree-sitter,
ts-morph) through repo map SQL queries and intelligence client types.

- LSP: add endLine/endColumn from symbol location ranges
- Tree-sitter: add endLine from node.endPosition across all symbol queries
- ts-morph: add endLine from getEndLineNumber() for imports and exports
- Repo map: return line/endLine from getFileSymbols, getUnusedExports,
  getTestOnlyExports SQL queries
- Intelligence client: update type signatures and cache types
- Navigate: show line ranges (start-end) in formatSymbol output
- Soul analyze: display :line-endLine in unused exports report
- Soul find: show line ranges in symbol details and "also:" hints

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- rename read_file → read with batch files API

Replace the single-file read_file tool with a batch-capable `read` tool.
New schema: files=[{path, ranges?, target?, name?}] supporting
multiple files and multiple ranges per file in a single call.

- Rewrite execute to handle array/single file specs with parallel reads
- Add smart truncation at 200 lines with symbol outline from repo map
- Add symbol outline for truncated AST extractions (>200 lines)
- Update error messages to reference new ranges syntax
- Update tool formatters for batch read display (file count, range count)
- Update tool grouping, display labels, icons, categories
- Update dispatch cache wrapper to handle new schema

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- overhaul setup wizard: inline model picker with provider-scoped fetch

Replace the old flow (set key → open separate LlmSelector) with an
integrated experience:
- Provider selection → key input → fetch models → pick model, all inline
- Add fetching phase with spinner, error phase with retry
- Fuzzy search within fetched model list
- onSelectModel now accepts modelId directly, App.tsx handles save
- Remove memo wrappers from wizard primitives (Gap, Hr, StepHeader, etc.)
- Remove memo from FirstRunWizard itself

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- track and display response duration on assistant messages

- Add durationMs to ChatMessage type
- Record responseStartedAt in useChat, set durationMs on completion
- Show "✓ Completed in Xm Ys" after assistant messages in MessageList
- Use formatElapsed in LockInStreamView for consistent time formatting

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- export soul-find/soul-grep internals for testing, add ranking + dep tests

- Export fileTypePenalty from soul-find for direct testing
- Export DepResolution, resolveDepSearch, annotateDepNoMatch from soul-grep
- Format long regex patterns (line length lint)
- Add soul-find-ranking.test.ts: file type penalty scoring
- Add soul-grep-dep.test.ts: dependency resolution logic

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- reorder tool definitions: soul tools first for model preference bias

Models prefer tools earlier in the list. Reorder from soul tools (TIER-1,
cheapest) → LSP → core read/edit → search fallbacks → shell → compound ops.
This reinforces the decision flow in the system prompt without adding tokens.

Stable ordering defined in STABLE_ORDER array, unknown tools appended at end.

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- slim down system prompt: remove cwd, projectInfo, forbidden, memory from builder

Move dynamic context (forbidden gates, memory index, project info) out of
the system prompt. Forbidden rules enforce at tool level, memory/project
info are injected via context messages instead. This reduces system prompt
size and improves prefix cache hit rates.

- Remove cwd, projectInfo, forbiddenContext, memoryContext from PromptBuilderOptions
- Simplify ContextManager.buildSystemPrompt() to only pass projectInstructions
- Trim projectInfo to just toolchain label (no file content)
- Update tests to match new prompt structure

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>

- Extract OptionRow component
- Use brand color instead of warning for question styling
- Add padding and bgInput for text input mode

Co-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
- refactor modal components: extract row components, remove unnecessary memos

CommandPalette, CommandPicker, LlmSelector, SessionPicker:

- Add consume() helper — stopPropagation + preventDefault on every global
  shortcut so child components never see them (fixes Ctrl+T toggling
  collapsed plans)
- Ctrl+O now toggles all expand/collapse (code + reasoning + plans) via
  new toggleAllExpanded() store action
- Bulletproof tab close: abort() no longer short-circuits on compaction,

- reset little_backend: god object, bad names, buried bugs (round 3)
- reset little_backend test arena to clean buggy state (round 3)
- reset little_backend test arena to clean buggy state
- add Forge label to assistant message header
- tab-scoped tasks, cache hardening, agent retry, prompt tightening
- move skills injection before tool guidance for better positional attention

Skills are user-chosen behavioral directives that were previously appended
at the very bottom of the system prompt — the attention dead zone between
mode instructions and the Soul Map data dump. Now they inject right after
identity + project info, before the tool guidance wall, where they compete
for attention with core behavioral rules.

Matches ECC/Claude Code finding on positional weight in system prompts.

- enable prompt caching for tool schemas

Mark the last tool in the tools object with cache_control ephemeral
so the Anthropic API caches the entire tools array as part of the
stable prefix (system prompt + tools). Verified the full chain:

  tool.providerOptions → AI SDK prepareToolsAndToolChoice (passes through)
  → @ai-sdk/anthropic prepareTools → validator.getCacheControl
  → cache_control field on AnthropicTool → API request

With 26+ tools at ~500 bytes each, this saves re-processing ~12k tokens
of tool schemas on every step after the first. Uses 1 of the 2 remaining
cache breakpoints (Anthropic allows 4, we use 2 for system+messages).
- compaction v2: make default, skip gap-fill when state is rich, add tests

- Default strategy v1 → v2: 75% cheaper per compaction (2k tokens vs 8k),
  better data visibility (sees full tool results before pruning)
- Skip LLM gap-fill when WSM has ≥15 slots — incremental extraction
  already captured the context, gap-fill usually returns "COMPLETE"
- 32 tests covering WSM state tracking, extraction pipeline (tool calls,
  tool results, user messages, assistant messages), serialization,
  buildV2Summary, and full integration cycle
- cap omitted findings file list, add agent-results tests

- Limit omitted findings file list to 10 names (prevents unbounded
  growth when agent has many findings)
- 51 tests for agent-results: formatDoneResult, synthesizeDoneFromResults,
  extractDoneResult, buildFallbackResult
- tighten dispatch synthesis: max 5 findings displayed, halve synthesis budget

- MAX_FINDINGS_DISPLAY = 5: cap findings shown in formatDoneResult,
  omitted findings listed as file paths only
- SYNTHESIS_BUDGET 8000 → 4000: less raw file content dumped when
  agent doesn't call done (common case)
- Worst case per agent now: 5 × 500 + 500 summary ≈ 3k chars
- 4-agent dispatch: ~12k typical (was 30-40k before all changes)
- reduce dispatch content echo: cap finding detail + truncate task text

- Cap per-finding detail to 500 chars in formatDoneResult (was unlimited
  from agent done calls, 2000 from synthesis). Main agent can read_file
  for full content. Saves ~1-4k per agent result.
- Truncate task text to first line (200 chars) in multi-agent sections.
  Main agent already knows what it dispatched — the enriched prompt with
  file outlines, peer findings, and dependency results was pure echo.
- Combined with existing 24KB toModelOutput cap, dispatch results are
  now bounded at: 4 agents × (500 summary + 500/finding × ~5 findings)
  ≈ 12-16k chars typical, vs 30-40k before.
- cap individual file size at 512KB
- shell compress: tee original on significant compression for agent recovery

- Export saveTee from tee.ts for direct use
- compressShellOutputFull returns {text, original} — original set when
  compression removed significant content (>10% reduction)
- Shell tool: saves original to tee file, appends [full output: path]
  so agent can cat the file if it needs uncompressed details
- Project tool: same tee-on-compress behavior
- Follows RTK pattern: zero inline tokens for noise, full recovery via disk
- token optimization: strip dispatch skill echo, compress shell output, cap dispatch size

- Strip "--- Relevant skill: ---" blocks from dispatch toModelOutput (main
  agent already has skills in system prompt, echoing saves 30-40k/dispatch)
- Cap dispatch output at 24KB with clean truncation
- Replace misleading "All file content included below" with read_file hint
- Add language-agnostic shell output compressor (shell-compress.ts):
  - Collapses passing test lines (jest/pytest/go/rust/TAP)
  - Truncates stack traces to 5 frames (JS/Python/Java/Rust/Ruby/C#/Go)
  - Suppresses progress bars and download noise
  - Collapses repeated similar lines (lint warnings, build output)
  - 60-80% reduction on typical test/build output
- Wire compressor into shell + project tools (runs before truncation)
- 21 tests covering all major language ecosystems
- add output truncation, max-columns, and source map exclusions
- UI polish: fix loading counter flicker, horizontal prompts, adaptive streaming, tab UX

LoadingStatus: fix elapsed counter and ghost icon flashing during streaming
by preserving imperative ref state across re-renders (elapsedSecRef, ghostTickRef)

QuestionPrompt & PlanReviewPrompt: horizontal button bar layout with left/right
navigation, remove verbose vertical option lists

TabBar: bracket-style tab indicators [1] with colored states for loading/error/unread

Streaming: adaptive chunking (line-based in code fences, word-based in prose),
coalesce rapid flush intervals (MIN_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS = 30)

Tab management: confirm before closing busy tabs (Ctrl+W and /close),
proper activity state via useState, abort in-flight chats on session restore

Sessions: sync listSessions/totalSizeBytes (remove unnecessary async),
simplified sessionDirSize

Misc: collapse diffs by default (Ctrl+O toggles), remove 'Forge' label from
assistant messages, prefer direct action over plans in system prompt,
fix session builder tab matching, simplify permission prompt options

- auto-dismiss task progress after all tasks complete

TaskProgress now hides after a 3s linger when all tasks are
done/blocked, instead of persisting indefinitely.

- add missing tool display entries (multi_edit, undo_edit, list_dir, rename_file)

Previously these tools had no category, icon, label, or formatArgs entry,
so they'd show as bare tool names with no file path in the UI.

Now multi_edit/undo_edit/list_dir show [file] badge + file path,
and rename_file shows [code] badge + from → to path.

Also includes steering message truncation in MessageList.

- harden agent bus, async repo-map scan, remove dead code

agent-bus.ts:
- Wrap all waiter notifications in try/catch via notifyWaiters()
- Wrap onCacheEvent/onToolCacheEvent callbacks in try/catch
- Add 300s timeout to file and tool result waiters to prevent hangs
- Skip self-waits when same agent re-reads a file it's already reading

repo-map:
- Convert collectFiles to async (fs/promises readdir/stat)
- Yield to event loop every 50 files during collection
- Yield more frequently during indexing (every 5 files vs 10)
- Add tick() calls between resolve/build/compute phases
- Pre-read file contents outside DB transaction in buildCallGraph
- Use imported readFileSync instead of require("node:fs")

context/manager.ts:
- Remove redundant repoMap.clear() before scan (scan handles it)

dead code removal:
- Remove unused exports: BASE_DELAY_MS, MAX_RETRIES,
  RETURN_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS, isRetryable (agent-runner.ts)
- Remove unused exports: DESLOPPIFY_PROMPT, VERIFY_PROMPT
  (agent-verification.ts)
- Remove dead functions: toolOk, catchToolError (tool-utils.ts)

- improve repo map cross-language quality and reduce ref noise

Repo map improvements:
- Add COMMON_LOCAL_NAMES filter (~120 ubiquitous variable names like
  name, path, file, text, content, result, key, args) that are never
  meaningful cross-file references — eliminates ~18% of ref noise
- Raise min identifier length from 3→4 chars (3-char ids are noise)
- Expand IDENTIFIER_KEYWORDS with comprehensive builtins for Python,
  Rust, Go, Java, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, Lua, Zig, Solidity, Dart
  and English stopwords that leak from comments
- Add import resolution for Java/Kotlin packages (com.foo.Bar → path),
  PHP namespaces (App\Models → path), Ruby lib/ prefix convention
- Expand isResolvable to flag Java/Kotlin/PHP imports for deferred
  resolution
- Add more resolveRelPath candidates: lib.rs, .go, index.php
- Relax resolveIdentifierRefs: resolve unique exports directly without
  requiring an existing import edge (use local symbol shadow check
  instead to prevent false positives)

Results (this codebase):
- Total refs: 37,710 → 30,944 (-18%)
- Call resolution: 97.9% → 100%
- Noise refs eliminated: ~6,800 common local names filtered
- Top unresolved are now project-specific (types, react, opentui)
  instead of generic words (name, path, file, text)

Other changes in this commit:
- LSP: multi-server support per language (e.g. biome + tsserver)
- LSP: findServersForLanguage returns all available servers
- LSP: diagnostics merge from all servers with dedup
- Subagent: handle NoObjectGeneratedError from AI SDK v6
- Memory: tighten tool description to write-only-when-asked

- bundled distribution, investigate agents, dispatch UI overhaul
- fix AGPL references across codebase to BSL 1.1
- switch from AGPL-3.0 to Business Source License 1.1
- Add proxy provider, code intelligence tools, and UI refinements

Proxy provider:
- Add CLIProxyAPI as a grouped LLM provider with auto-install/start lifecycle
- Add /proxy, /proxy login, /proxy install commands
- Generalize gateway-only model selector to support any grouped provider
- Replace useGatewayModels with useGroupedModels hook

Code intelligence:
- Add intelligence router with ts-morph, tree-sitter, regex, and LSP backends
- Add navigate, read_code, refactor, and analyze tools for static analysis
- Add post-edit diagnostics to edit_file tool
- Add tree-sitter-wasms, ts-morph, web-tree-sitter dependencies

UI:
- Redesign ReasoningBlock with rail styling and braille spinner
- Simplify HealthCheck from table to inline layout
- Add GhostLogo component
- Add noAltScreen option for suspend (OAuth login flow)

Streaming:
- Handle error parts in stream to surface API failures
- Fall back gracefully on NoOutputGeneratedError
- Save full tool call history in sessions instead of text-only
- Fix table overflow in chat — constrain columns to terminal width

Tables now measure available width and shrink columns proportionally
when they would overflow. Cell text is truncated with ellipsis instead
of pushing other columns off screen.

### Refactor

- prompt updates, async DiffView, compaction return type, cost breakdown improvements
- UI polish, context bar simplification, repo map token budget, worker memory tracking, lint fixes & test updates
- collapse re-export symbols in repo map render
- remove shell search redirect gate\n\nRemove checkSearchAntiPattern and the blocking redirect layer that\nprevented shell from running grep/cat/find commands. This gate was\noverly aggressive and incorrectly blocked legitimate git and shell\noperations. The softer post-success hints in shell.ts are retained.
- clean up stream options, subagent tools, tab instance, and context manager\n\nCo-Authored-By: SoulForge <soulforge@proxysoul.com>
